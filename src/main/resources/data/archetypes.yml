# Enemy Archetypes
# Managed via /vrs admin spawner archetype commands
#
# Structure:
# archetypes:
#   <archetypeId>:
#     enemyType: "minecraft:entity_type"
#     weight: 1.0
#     spawnCommands:
#       - "command with {placeholders}"
#     rewards:
#       xpBase: 10
#       xpPerLevel: 5
#       coinBase: 1
#       coinPerLevel: 1
#       permaScoreChance: 0.01
#
# Available placeholders for spawnCommands:
#   {sx}, {sy}, {sz} - spawn coordinates
#   {runWorld} - the world where the run is active (auto-wrapped if not specified)
#   {enemyLevel} - calculated enemy level
#   {enemyType} - the entity type from archetype config
#
# NOTE: Commands are automatically wrapped with "execute in {runWorld} run ..." if they
# don't already start with "execute in". This ensures mobs spawn in the correct world.
#
# Example:
#   zombie:
#     enemyType: "minecraft:zombie"
#     weight: 3.0
#     spawnCommands:
#       - "summon zombie {sx} {sy} {sz} {Tags:[\"vrs_mob\",\"vrs_lvl_{enemyLevel}\"]}"
#     rewards:
#       xpBase: 10
#       xpPerLevel: 5
#       coinBase: 1
#       coinPerLevel: 1
#       permaScoreChance: 0.01
