# Enemy Archetypes
# Managed via /vrs admin spawner archetype commands
#
# Structure:
# archetypes:
#   <archetypeId>:
#     enemyType: "minecraft:entity_type"
#     weight: 1.0
#     minSpawnLevel: 1           # Minimum enemy level required to spawn this archetype
#     spawnCommands:
#       - "command with {placeholders}"
#     rewards:
#       xpAmount: 10             # Fixed XP reward amount
#       xpChance: 1.0            # Probability (0-1) to award XP
#       coinAmount: 1            # Fixed coin reward amount
#       coinChance: 1.0          # Probability (0-1) to award coins
#       permaScoreAmount: 1      # Fixed perma-score reward amount
#       permaScoreChance: 0.01   # Probability (0-1) to award perma-score
#
# Available placeholders for spawnCommands:
#   {sx}, {sy}, {sz} - spawn coordinates
#   {runWorld} - the world where the run is active (auto-wrapped if not specified)
#   {enemyLevel} - calculated enemy level
#   {enemyType} - the entity type from archetype config
#   {archetypeId} - the archetype ID (IMPORTANT: use in Tags for reward lookup)
#
# NOTE: Commands are automatically wrapped with "execute in {runWorld} run ..." if they
# don't already start with "execute in". This ensures mobs spawn in the correct world.
#
# Level Gating:
#   minSpawnLevel controls when an archetype joins the spawn pool.
#   Only archetypes where minSpawnLevel <= currentEnemyLevel are considered.
#   The weighted pool is dynamically recalculated from eligible archetypes only.
#
# Reward System:
#   Each reward type (XP, coins, perma-score) is rolled independently:
#   - Roll random(0,1) < chance => award the fixed amount
#   - No level scaling - rewards are fixed values with probability
#
# Example progression setup:
#   zombie:                       # Common, available from start
#     enemyType: "minecraft:zombie"
#     weight: 3.0
#     minSpawnLevel: 1
#     spawnCommands:
#       - "summon zombie {sx} {sy} {sz} {Tags:[\"vrs_mob\",\"vrs_lvl_{enemyLevel}\",\"vrs_arch_{archetypeId}\"]}"
#     rewards:
#       xpAmount: 10
#       xpChance: 1.0
#       coinAmount: 1
#       coinChance: 1.0
#       permaScoreAmount: 1
#       permaScoreChance: 0.01
#
#   skeleton:                     # Appears at level 5+
#     enemyType: "minecraft:skeleton"
#     weight: 2.0
#     minSpawnLevel: 5
#     spawnCommands:
#       - "summon skeleton {sx} {sy} {sz} {Tags:[\"vrs_mob\",\"vrs_lvl_{enemyLevel}\",\"vrs_arch_{archetypeId}\"]}"
#     rewards:
#       xpAmount: 15
#       xpChance: 1.0
#       coinAmount: 2
#       coinChance: 0.8
#       permaScoreAmount: 1
#       permaScoreChance: 0.02
#
#   wither_skeleton:              # Rare, appears at level 15+
#     enemyType: "minecraft:wither_skeleton"
#     weight: 1.0
#     minSpawnLevel: 15
#     spawnCommands:
